/**
 A rubric criterion rating is one of the pre-defined
 ratings that can be selected for assignemnts that are graded
 on a rubric.
 
 For example, a rubric criterion for "Grammar" might have 3 ratings,
 5 points for "Perfect", 3 for "OK", and 1 for "Too many mistakes."
 
 In addition, some rubrics allow teachers to assign custom points
 when one of the pre-defined options is not fine-grained enough. In
 this case, they may choose to include a comment explaining the custom
 grade.
